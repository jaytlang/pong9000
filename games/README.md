# Games!

This directory contains all currently supported sources for on-database games. Other than the game browser itself, this includes...
* Billiards: turn-based ball physics!
* Pokemon: randomized battle simulator, true to the original!

The source in this directory is compliant to the FPSR spec and builds completely under the compiler. Copy these into [Post-It](https://web.mit.edu/jaytlang/postcode/) and play away!

# pong 9000

Massively multiplayer, just-in-time executed game system running on an ESP32. This README terribly needs an update, but so far we've built the basis of game logic, server-side information, and notably the just-in-time C interpreter. You'll find this, plus other stuff, in the repo thus far.

More to come!

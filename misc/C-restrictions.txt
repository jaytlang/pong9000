EVERYTHING EXCEPT
- for loops
- floating pt: integer and char and pointers only
- += -= *= /=
- structs
- preprocessor - no #include or #define - use global variables
- switch statements
- definition-time instantiation of variables.
    you MUST define all variables at the top of a function or the global context, and then AFTER all instantiation is done you may assign them values. Don't interleave declarations and assignments - this is ANSI C!
- char mystr[50] = "....", use this instead
    char *mystr;
    mystr = (char*)heapalloc(50*sizeof(char))
